<br>I am currently looking at how children perceive and interact with humanoid robots, especially when they make mistakes. One primary goal is studying how children can benefit educationally and achieve learning gains from teaching the robots. <br><img src='http://kexin-yang.github.io/images/TR/nao_playing.png?raw=true' alt='Photo' style='width: 650px;'/>"

This is still ongoing unpublished work, and will be shared when the project is finished. The main focus is on studying the Topaze effect and benefit of learning by teaching a humanoid robot, as well as how children perceive robots' brains, their intelligence when the robots make mistakes. With assistance of Curiosity Notebook (shown below), a learning-by-teaching platform with conversational agents.
