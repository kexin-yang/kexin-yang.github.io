This project involve educational data mining and visualization. In this project advised by Dr. Adam Perer from Human-Computer Interaction Institute in CMU, I explored ways to visualize learning pathways of students who are enrolled in a blended course Principle of Computing in Python. 
 
 Using D3, tableau and other interactive data visualization tools, me together with my teammates visualized studentsâ€™ data in order to give educators evidence-based recommendation about teaching.
