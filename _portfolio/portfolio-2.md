Here present some small class projects of intelligent tutoring system in STEM area, including math, chemistry and biology, that I have built in Dr. Vincent Alevenâ€™s _Personalized Online Learning_ course. These intelligent tutoring systems demonstrate some features of adaptivity in problem-specific feedback, allowing multiple paths and mastery learning with skill and KC modeling. 
Tutor 1: 
Domain: Math/ Chemistry:
This intelligent tutoring system aims at teaching students how to do dosage calculation for medicine.

The feature of this intelligent tutoring system is its ability of 1) calculating for students and 2) mass production.
1. Calculating for Students:
This means when students type in a textInput box a formula such as 120*3, if the right answer is indeed 360, the tutor can do the calculation for the students and recognize this as correct answer. This function makes use of the AlgEval() algorithm inside CTAT.
2. Mass Production: This is a function made possible by Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT). This enables people to create multiple questions using the same interface components, same production rules, or .brd file. Only thing people need to do is to substitute the problem specific information in the excel form as shown below, in order to create multiple problem in the same nature.
