**Duration**: 10 weeks, Oct 2nd, 2018 - Dec.16th, 2018 

**Designer**:Kexin Yang

In this project, I applied the backward design methodology and designed a 10-hour course in argumentative writing for Grade 11-12. The development of this course design are divided into five phases, namely, learners in context, Goals, Assessment, Instruction and Research& Evaluation.   

The project draws on educational big ideas from Understanding by Design by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe, and The ABC of How we Learn written by Daniel L. Schwartz et al.  

Each phase of educational design is backed up by theoretical evidence, through many times of iteration, under supervision of two professors.

This is a final project for a core course of METALS program (Master of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences) in Carnegie Mellon University. The course name is Educational Goals, Instruction and Assessment, taught by Dr. Sharon Carver and Dr. Lauren Herckis.
