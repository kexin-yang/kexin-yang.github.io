With goal of increasing teachers' satisfaction and sustaining the relevance of materials in intelligent tutoring system, without imposing too much time on the busy teachers, in this recent research, I studied how might teachers guide the crowd to perform improvement on existing instructional materials (math on-demand hints)in intelligent tutoring system.

**Duration**: Jan 2019 - Oct 2019
**Advisors**: Dr. Ken Holstein, Prof. Vincent Aleven and Prof. Joseph Jay Williams

**Motivation:**
AI-based tutoring systems are increasingly common in K-12 classrooms and are proved to be effective for increasing students' outcome. 
However, as teachers using the intelligent tutoring systems in classroom sometimes expressed not perfectly satisfied some instructional materials in the systems, as not helpful enough for assisting students' learning.
Teachers expressed desire to customize the materials, yet are short of the time to do so, thus, we seek to improve teachers' satisfaction without imposing too much on their time, and explored a combination of teachersourcing and crowdsourcing for the instructional materials improvement.

Two studies were conducted to test the respective effectiveness of the teacher-crowd pipeline. Follow-up data analysis inform some design recommendations for future teacher-crowd pipeline for materials improvement.
