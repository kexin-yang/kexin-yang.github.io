In this project, I applied the backward design methodology and designed a 10-hour course in argumentative writing for Grade 11-12. I highlighted three phases, namely, learners in context, Goals, Assessment, Instruction and Research& Evaluation. The project draw on educational big ideas from Understanding by Design by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe, and The ABC of How we Learn written by Daniel L. Schwartz, Jessica M.Tsang and Kristen P. Blair.  

In this project, every phase of educational design is justified by rigorous theoretical support, through many times of iteration, under supervision of Dr. Sharon Carver and Dr. Lauren Herckis in CMU.

This is a final project for an indispensable, core course for the METALS master program in Carnegie Mellon University, Educational Goals, Instruction and Assessment, taught by Dr. Sharon Carver and Dr. Lauren Herckis.
