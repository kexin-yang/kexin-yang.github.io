**Duration**: 7 months, Jan 2018 - Aug 2018 

**Team**:Kexin Yang, Greg Bunyea, Yihong Shi, Canhai Chen, Jiasi Tan

**Advisors**: Prof. Ken Koedinger and Prof. Bruce MacLaren

My master's capstone project, sponsored by Renaissance Learning, Inc, involved investigating K-12 school administratorsâ€™ need for comparing students' performance with demographically similar schools. The result of a 7-month research, design, development and testing cycle, the Enlighten Dashboard allows administrators to compare, analyze, and connect to schools most similar to their own.

## The Enlighten Dashboard: 
I invite you to try out the [[Enlighten dashboard]](https://demo.enlighten.education/),which allows school administrators to compare students' performance with demographically similar schools, and connect to people in these like-context schools.  

## Project Website:
Visit our [[project website]](https://enlighten.education/) that documents the full research, design and development cycle of the 7 month in detail.
