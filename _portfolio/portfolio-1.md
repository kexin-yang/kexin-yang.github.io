\#Dashboard Design and Development, \#Mining large datasets<br> 
\#UX research and design, \#Addressing K-12 administrators' needs

## The Enlighten Dashboard: 
My master's capstone project, sponsored by Renaissance Learning, Inc, involved investigating K-12 school administratorsâ€™ need for comparing students' performance with demographically similar schools. The result of a 7-month research, design, development and testing cycle, the Enlighten Dashboard allows administrators to compare, analyze, and connect to schools most similar to their own.
Usability testing shows our system achieved a System Usability Scale(SUS) score of 82.5 indicating high usability, and translates to an A on an A-F scale.

**I invite you to try out this novel** [[Enlighten dashboard]](https://demo.enlighten.education/)which allows school administrators to compare students' performance with demographically similar schools, and connect to people in these like-context schools.
