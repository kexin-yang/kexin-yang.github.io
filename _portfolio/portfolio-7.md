This project involve educational data mining and visualization. In this project advised by Prof. Adam Perer (CMU, HCII), I explored ways to visualize learning pathways of students who are enrolled in a blended course Principle of Computing in Python. 
 
Using D3, tableau and other interactive data visualization tools, my teammates and I visualized studentsâ€™ data in order to give educators evidence-based recommendation about teaching.
