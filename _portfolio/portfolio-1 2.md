##Background

The initial reason for building this intelligent tutor is to make learning RST more engaging and efficient. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) is a linguistics framework, frequently used in information retrieval area, that focuses on identifying relations between sentences. RST, while being a useful framework, has very few learning materials other than academic papers or textbook. Since I personally spent two whole days reading academic paper trying to learn it, which was unengaging and laborious, I decided to explore ways to make the RST learning process more effective and interesting.
   
## The strength of this intelligent tutoring systemsï¼š 
Firstly, it adopts **mastery learning** and use **adaptive problem selection** with problems involving unmastered skills, in order to ensure learners reach mastery in each relation.  

Secondly, the problems are presented **from easy to hard**, and give adaptive feedback to ensure learners stay on the right track.  

Thirdly, it is held on a public server, Tutorshop, which enable its **free accessibility** by anyone interested in learning or teaching RST.  

###Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) method: 
**Think aloud** with four different difficulty factors

For now we went through three major iterations of our tutor interfaces, and we continue to improve this tutor with more iteration.
