I am currently a graduate student in HCI Lab, School of Computer Science in University of Waterloo. I am in Teachable Robot Lab working with Prof. Edith Law (CS), and collaborate with the Cognitive Development Lab directed by Prof. Elizabeth Nilsen (Psychology), where I study how kids perceive teachable humanoid robots and learn from teaching them. 
I graduated from the School of Computer Science in Carnegie Mellon University, where I majored in Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences ([METALS](https://hcii.cmu.edu/masters-educational-technology-and-applied-learning-science-program-overview)) at Human-Computer Interaction Institute.
During my time in CMU, I was advised by Prof. [Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) from Langauge Technology Institute (LTI), Prof. [Vincent Aleven](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/vincent-aleven) from HCII, and Prof. [Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com) from Computer Science department, University of Toronto. I also worked closely with the amazing Ph.D. students and post-docs in CMU HCII and LTI, including [Ken Holstein](https://kenholstein.myportfolio.com/), [Xu Wang](http://www.iamxuwang.com/), [Tomoshiro Nagashima](https://tomonag.org/) and [Shiyan Jiang](http://shiyanjiang.com/visual/).
I received my Bachelor's Degree in Beijing Normal University in English language literature, focusing on language education. I have taught English in various public schools and private institutions, including [Beijing 101 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_101_Middle_School), Meitan Qiushi High School, [Knovva Academy](https://www.knovva.com), and [Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press](http://en.fltrp.com). 
 
Background
===
My teaching experiences in various schools exposed me to many **challenges faced by K-12 students and teachers** in their daily work. To name a few, students I taught from an under-developed province lack quality teacher resources; teachers I worked with at a top high school in China said they felt exhausted with heavy workload, petty tasks and keeping up with the accelerated students. At that time, with the rapid development of technologies (e.g. machine learning and MOOC), I felt technologies could be of help for coping these challenges faced by teachers and students.   

This led me to pursue graduate study in Educational Technology in Carnegie Mellon University HCII and Computer Sciences in HCI Lab at UWaterloo, where I got in touch with various cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence in education and HCI, which greatly inspired my interest in further study in this area. 

Research Area
===
   My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Learning Science and Artificial Intelligence. 
   
   My past work focuses on **learning sciences and technologies**, including artificial intelligence (AI) in education, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), language technology and educational robots. I am passionate about supporting students to learn more effectively and educators to work more efficiently.  
  
   I am also interested in **social computing** and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), including crowdsourcing, learnersourcing, and a broad range of HCI topics that seek to support people's emotional and physical well-being.

Acknowledge
===
I appreciate deeply of friends and family in China, U.S. and Canada who support me unconditionally. I also especially want to acknowledge the professors, advisors and mentors I have had the fortune to work with, who supported, encouraged and inspired me in my academic career.    

I was fortunate to be educated by the "teachers of teachers" from arguably the best normal Univeristy in China. Many professors, including Prof. Zehang Chen, Prof. Xiaofang Qian, Prof. Hong Jiang have not only passed on knowledge to students, but cared deeply about whether we survive and thrive in our college lives. 
My undergraduate thesis advisor, Prof. Hui Yu, was the first professor who introduced me to academic research. I noticed the heavy local accent hindering students' confidence to speak English from volunteer teaching, and wanted to study this (negative phonetic transfer) as thesis. Prof. Yu supported this decision and encouraged me to study what I am interested, even though this is peripheral to her main research.

Prof. [Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) (Carnegie Mellon University, LTI/HCII) was my first graduate level advisor, who involved me in my first HCI/AIED research project on automated writing feedback. Her passion, dedication, efficiency and highly organized way of work had huge impact on me. She spares no effort to help support her students in ways, and I always remember the sincere advice she gave me on research, keeping physical and psychological health and long-term career development.   

Prof. [Vincent Aleven](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/vincent-aleven) (Carnegie Mellon University, HCII) and his post-doc Ken Holstein have shown me how devoted and passionate people can be in their work in ways I have never expected. Doing research with them is like an adventure together. The first research project I led (on teacher-guided crowdsourcing) had transforming influence on me. Being mentored by Vincent, Ken and Prof. Joseph Jay Williams (U of Toronto), I have felt so inspired, motivated and well-supported, and learned so much more than I can imagine.  

As for my current advisors Prof. [Edith Law](http://edithlaw.ca/), my appreciation is also beyond words - for her trust in us, supporting our interest, and dedication to her work.  My thanks also go to other mentors who have shown great support, including Prof. Elizabeth Nilsen (UWaterloo), Prof. Shiyan Jiang (NCSU), Xu Wang(CMU), Tomohiro Nagashima (CMU).

I am really fortunate to have met these people who are not only great mentors, but also wonderful human-being.
