I am currently a graduate student in HCI Lab in University of Waterloo. I collaborate with the Cognitive Development Lab directed by Prof. Elizabeth Nilsen (Psychology department), where I study how pre-school childlren learn knowledge from the process of teaching.   

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Beijing Normal University in English language literature, focusing on language education. I have taught English in various public schools and private institutions, including [101 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_101_Middle_School), Meitan Qiushi High School, [Knovva Academy](https://www.knovva.com), and [Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press](http://en.fltrp.com). 

Acknowledgement
===
I appreciate everyone who supported, encouraged and inspired me in my life. My friends, family, professors and mentors.    
 
My undergraduate thesis advisor, Prof. Hui Yu (BNU), was the first one who introduced me to academic research. She supported my interest in doing thesis on negative phonetic transfer even though that was peripheral to her research. 

Prof. [Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) (CMU, LTI/HCII), who introduced me to my first HCI/AIED research project on automated writing feedback. Her passion, dedication, efficiency and highly organized way of work hugely impacted me. I appreciate her sincere advice on work and life, and help and support when I need the most. 

Prof. [Vincent Aleven](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/vincent-aleven)  and Dr. [Ken Holstein](https://kenholstein.myportfolio.com/) (CMU HCII) have shown me how devoted and passionate people can be in their work. Doing research with them is like an adventure. I led my first research project (on teacher-guided crowdsourcing) which had transforming influence on me. I felt so inspired, motivated and well-supported working with them, and learned so much more than I can imagine. 

As for my current advisors Prof. [Edith Law](http://edithlaw.ca/) and Prof. [Elizabeth Nilsen](https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/elizabeth-nilsen), their trust and support to us is beyond words, and I especially appreciate them introducing me to this new and interesting area of teachable agent and educational robot.
