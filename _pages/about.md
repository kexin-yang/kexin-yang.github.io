* I am currently a graduate student in HCI Lab, School of Computer Science in University of Waterloo, working with [Prof. Edith Law](http://edithlaw.ca/).
* I graduated from the School of Computer Sciences in Carnegie Mellon University, where I majored in [Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences](https://metals.hcii.cmu.edu) at [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu).
* During my time in CMU, I was advised by Prof. [Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) from Langauge Technology Institute (LTI), Prof. [Vincent Aleven](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/vincent-aleven) from HCII, Prof. [Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com) from Computer Science department, University of Toronto. I worked with the amazing Ph.D. students and post-docs in CMU HCII and LTI, including [Ken Holstein](https://kenholstein.myportfolio.com/), [Xu Wang](http://www.iamxuwang.com/), [Tomoshiro Nagashima](https://tomonag.org/) and [Shiyan Jiang](http://shiyanjiang.com/visual/).
* In my capstone, I did data mining and UX research for [Renaissance Learning Inc.](https://www.renaissance.com), an international learning analytics company that produce cloud-based K-12 educational software. Our team designed and built an interactive dashboard for schools to compare and connect with like-context schools.    
  
  Prior to grad school, I have interned at [Knovva Academy](https://www.knovva.com) as an instructional designer, [Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press](http://en.fltrp.com) as a Digital Media Editor, and as a English Teacher at one of the top high schools in China, [Beijing 101 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_101_Middle_School).
  
  
  **Research Interest**

   My research focus on **learning science and technology**, including intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), language technology and teachable robots, to make education easier and more effective.  
    
   I also study the mechanism of **crowdsourcing and teachersourcing**, to improve the ITS development and design process, and increase teachers' configurability.
