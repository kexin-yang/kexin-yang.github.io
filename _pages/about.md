I am currently a graduate student in HCI Lab in University of Waterloo. 
I collaborate with the Cognitive Development Lab directed by Prof. Elizabeth Nilsen (Psychology department), where I study how pre-school childlren learn knowledge from the process of teaching.   

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Beijing Normal University in English language literature, focusing on language education. I have taught English in various public schools and private institutions, including [101 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_101_Middle_School), Meitan Qiushi High School, [Knovva Academy](https://www.knovva.com), and [Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press](http://en.fltrp.com). 

My recent research focus on learning sciences, specifically, on topic related to 1) Learning by teaching; 2) collaborative learning in math domain.
