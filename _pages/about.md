I am a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Beijing Normal University in English language literature, focusing on language education. I have taught English in various public schools and private institutions, including [101 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_101_Middle_School), Meitan Qiushi High School, [Knovva Academy](https://www.knovva.com), and [Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press](http://en.fltrp.com).
   
Research Area
===
   My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Learning Science. 
   
   I am interested in **learning sciences and technologies**. My work touches on artificial intelligence (AI) in education, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), language technology, educational robots and XR in education. 
   I am curious about how educational technologies can support students learn more effectively and educators to work more efficiently.  
  
   I have also worked on projects related to **social computing** and **computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW)**, primarily in expert-guided crowdsourcing and learnersourcing.

My name
===
I go by Bella or Kexin, and don't really have a preference :) If you are curious about pronunciation of "Kexin", here is a useful [website](https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-pinyin-chart.php) where you can click to hear **kě (可)** and **xīn (馨)** respectively.
