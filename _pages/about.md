* I am now a master student majoring in [Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences](https://metals.hcii.cmu.edu) at [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu) in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. 
[Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/). I also have the valuable chances to work closely in research with Prof. [Vincent Aleven](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/vincent-aleven) from HCII CMU, Prof. [Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com) from Computer Science department, University of Toronto, and three wonderful Ph.D. students in CMU HCII.
* I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn), majoring in English language literature, with a focus on language education.
* I am interested in using learning sciences theory and educational technology, including intelligent tutoring system and learning analytics, to make education easy, effective and equal.
