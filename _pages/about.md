I am a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Beijing Normal University in English language literature, focusing on language education. I have taught English in various public schools and private institutions, including [101 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_101_Middle_School), Meitan Qiushi High School, [Knovva Academy](https://www.knovva.com), and [Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press](http://en.fltrp.com).
 
My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Learning Science.    

I go by Bella or Kexin :) If you are curious about pronunciation of "Kexin", here is a useful [website](https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-pinyin-chart.php) where you can click to hear **kě (可)** and **xīn (馨)** respectively.
