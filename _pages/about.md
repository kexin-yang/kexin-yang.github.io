I am currently a graduate student in HCI Lab, School of Computer Science in University of Waterloo. I am in Teachable Robot Lab working with Prof. Edith Law (CS), and collaborate with the Cognitive Development Lab directed by Prof. Elizabeth Nilsen (Psychology), where I study how kids perceive teachable humanoid robots and learn from teaching them.   

I graduated from the School of Computer Science in Carnegie Mellon University, where I majored in Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences ([METALS](https://hcii.cmu.edu/masters-educational-technology-and-applied-learning-science-program-overview)) at Human-Computer Interaction Institute.  

During my time in CMU, I was advised by Prof. [Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) from Langauge Technology Institute (LTI), Prof. [Vincent Aleven](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/vincent-aleven) from HCII, and Prof. [Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com) from Computer Science department, University of Toronto. I also worked closely with the amazing Ph.D. students and post-docs in CMU HCII and LTI, including [Ken Holstein](https://kenholstein.myportfolio.com/), [Xu Wang](http://www.iamxuwang.com/), [Tomoshiro Nagashima](https://tomonag.org/) and [Shiyan Jiang](http://shiyanjiang.com/visual/).  

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Beijing Normal University in English language literature, focusing on language education. I have taught English in various public schools and private institutions, including [Beijing 101 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_101_Middle_School), Meitan Qiushi High School, [Knovva Academy](https://www.knovva.com), and [Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press](http://en.fltrp.com). 
 
Why research in this area?
===
My teaching experiences in various schools exposed me to many **challenges faced by K-12 students and teachers** in their daily work. To name a few, students I taught from an under-developed province lack quality teacher resources; teachers I worked with at a top high school in China said they felt exhausted with heavy workload, petty tasks and keeping up with the accelerated students. 

At that time, with the rapid development of technologies (e.g. machine learning and MOOC), I felt technologies could be of help for coping these challenges faced by teachers and students. This led me to pursue graduate study in Educational Technology in Carnegie Mellon University HCII and Computer Sciences in HCI Lab at UWaterloo, where I got in touch with various cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence in education and HCI, which greatly inspired my interest in further study in this area. 

Research Area
===
   My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Learning Science and Artificial Intelligence. 
   
   My past work focuses on **learning sciences and technologies**, including artificial intelligence (AI) in education, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), language technology and educational robots. I am passionate about supporting students to learn more effectively and educators to work more efficiently.  
  
   I am also interested in **social computing** and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), including crowdsourcing, learnersourcing, and a broad range of HCI topics that seek to support people's emotional and physical well-being.

Acknowledge
===
I appreciate everyone who supported, encouraged and inspired me in my life. My friends, family and especially, professors and mentors.    
 
My undergraduate thesis advisor, Prof. Hui Yu (BNU), was the first one who introduced me to academic research. I wanted to study the negative phonetic transfer as thesis, as I noticed from teaching that students' accent can seriously hinder their confidence to speak English. I appreciate Prof. Yu on supporting me to do thesis on what I am interested, even though it was peripheral to her research.

Prof. [Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) (CMU, LTI/HCII), my first graduate level advisor, involved me in my first HCI/AIED research project on automated writing feedback. Her passion, dedication, efficiency and highly organized way of work hugely impacted me. I appreciate her sincere advice on work and life, and help and support when I needed the most. 

Prof. [Vincent Aleven](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/vincent-aleven)  and [Ken Holstein](https://kenholstein.myportfolio.com/) (CMU HCII) have shown me how devoted and passionate people can be in their work. Doing research with them is like an adventure. I led my first research project (on teacher-guided crowdsourcing) which had transforming influence on me. I felt so inspired, motivated and well-supported working with them, and learned so much more than I can imagine. 

My current advisors Prof. [Edith Law](http://edithlaw.ca/) showed great trust and support to us and dedication to her work. She is often very genuinely curious about what might happen in our experiment. Thanks to her, I have a chance to study teachable agent and educational robot, research topics that I find fascinating.
