# Research Project

## Automatic Structural Feedback for Student Essays  
**Funded by: Schimdt Family Foundation**   

**Advisor: Dr. Carolyn Rose**



This research, under the supervision of Dr. Carolyn Rosé from Language Technology Institute in Carnegie Mellon University, aims to make essay grading process more efficient using text-mining and deep learning technologies. This project is funded by Schmidt Family Foundation and is in collaboration with Turnitin, a language technology company.   

In the project, I applied Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) in decomposing students’ essays to give structural feedback. Based on empirical experience, we developed two deliverables to benefit other researchers, including a flowchart and a guideline for RST annotation in the context of student essays. We are now working on parsing to scale up this work using neural networks.   

This research will be directly applied to the Turnitin company and produce visible results in their essay grading process.   

Since this is still unpublished work, the two coding manuals are for now confidential. In specific circumstances, I will consider sharing upon request.   

My personal journal for this research project is documented [here](http://kexin-yang.github.io/files/TII_Journal.pdf), a little cluttered, but recorded my first three months journey of this research project.
