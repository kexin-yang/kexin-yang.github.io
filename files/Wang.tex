\begin{rSection}{Research Experience}
\begin{rSubsection}{Personalized Article Recommendation}{Sep. 2017 - Present}{Advisor: Prof. Yong Yu}{APEX Data $\&$ Knowledge Management Lab, SJTU}
\item This study focuses on recommending most relevant textual advertisements to users to maximize the Click-Through-Rate, in which the major challenge is how to match user interests with proper articles
\item Employing hierarchical attention mechanism to obtain article embeddings and construct user interests
\end{rSubsection}
\begin{rSubsection}{Neural Link Prediction over Aligned Networks}{Aug. 2017 - Sep. 2017}{Advisor: Prof. Yong Yu}{APEX Data $\&$ Knowledge Management Lab, SJTU}
\item This study explored link prediction over aligned networks, which are common in real world, yet little studied. The major challenge is the heterogeneousness of the considered networks, which could be addressed well by our proposed model.
\item Implemented baseline \emph{LINE: Large-scale Information Network Embedding} in Tensorflow and tuned parameters
\item Surveyed papers about social networks and contributed lots of submits to our final paper
\item Extended the idea of two aligned networks to multi-aligned networks which we left as future work
\end{rSubsection}
\begin{rSubsection}{Dynamic Attention Deep Model for Article Recommendation
by Learning Human Editors’ Demonstration}{Oct. 2016 - Feb. 2017}{Advisor: Prof. Weinan Zhang}{APEX Data $\&$ Knowledge Management Lab, SJTU}
\item This task is, essentially, a binary classification problem for articles, in which the major challenge is modeling the editors' underlying criterion varied with many factors such as time, current affairs, etc.
\item Employed attention mechanism to address data drift problem, resulting in more robust and stable predictions
\item Proposed a Dynamic Attention Deep Model (DADM) which outperformed other baselines in an A/B test
\item Our paper was accepted to KDD 2017 and the proposed DADM model was utilized in practical cases, automating the quality article selection process to alleviate the editors' working load
