\begin{rSubsection}{Dynamic Attention Deep Model for Article Recommendation
by Learning Human Editors’ Demonstration}{Oct. 2016 - Feb. 2017}{Advisor: Prof. Weinan Zhang}{APEX Data $\&$ Knowledge Management Lab, SJTU}  
\vspace{-3pt}
\item This task is, essentially, a binary classification problem for articles, in which the major challenge is modeling the editors' underlying criterion varied with many factors such as time, current affairs, etc.
\item Employed attention mechanism to address data drift problem, resulting in more robust and stable predictions
\item Proposed a Dynamic Attention Deep Model (DADM) which outperformed other baselines in an A/B test
\item Our paper was accepted to KDD 2017 and the proposed DADM model was on trial, automating the quality article selection process to alleviate the editors' working load
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Neural Link Prediction over Aligned Networks}{Aug. 2017 - Sep. 2017}{Advisor: Prof. Yong Yu}{APEX Data $\&$ Knowledge Management Lab, SJTU}
\item This study explored link prediction over aligned networks, which are common in real world, yet little studied. The major challenge is the heterogeneousness of the considered networks, which could be addressed well by our proposed model.
\item Implemented baseline \emph{LINE: Large-scale Information Network Embedding} in Tensorflow and tuned parameters
\item Surveyed papers about social networks and contributed lots of submits to our final paper
\item Extended the idea of two aligned networks to multi-aligned networks which we left as future work
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Personalized Article Recommendation}{Sep. 2017 - Present}{Advisor: Prof. Yong Yu}{APEX Data $\&$ Knowledge Management Lab, SJTU}
\item This study focuses on recommending most relevant textual advertisements to users to maximize the Click-Through-Rate, in which the major challenge is how to match user interests with proper articles
\item Employing hierarchical attention mechanism to obtain article embeddings and construct user previous interests
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{DOC-SVM: DMD-based One-class SVM for Texture Clustering}{April. 2016 - Oct. 2016}{Advisor: Prof. William Sethares}{UW-Madison}
\item Proposed a textures clustering algorithm based on semi-supervised learning and One-class SVM. Solved problem of Inkjet Paper Competition with accuracy of 82.22\%. Achieved over 93\% on several public available datasets.  
\item Learned representative models from a single texture image, where the distance matrix to the prediction was especially appropriate for high-dimensional feature vectors.
\item Transformed unsupervised learning on texture images into semi-supervised learning method with higher accuracy.
\item Modified nearest neighbor chain algorithm for greater compatibility with the one-class SVM and the texture data.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Alternative Code for Depth Info in Structured Light Camera}{Feb. 2016 - May. 2016}{Advisor: Prof. Mohit Gupta}{Optimization Lab, UW-Madison}
\item Built a camera-projector system and solved the problems of radiometric calibration and geometric calibration. Tested gray code on checkerboard with image-taken experiments and analyzing changes on mean pixel values.
\item Wrote programs to test different patterns performance for point cloud and depth image in structured light.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{AceMap: Displaying Relationship among Academic Literatures}{Sep. 2015 - Oct. 2016}{Advisor: Prof. Xinbing Wang}{Research Center of Intelligent Internet of Things, SJTU}
\item Leader of Web Crawler Group: Led a ten-person team to investigate web crawlers' efficiency and seize information of over 30 million paper on both static and dynamic webpages. Utilized IP pools, random latency setting, browser automation and random user agents with tools including Selenium, PhantomJS and Beautifulsoup.
\item Member of Academic Recommender System Group: Proposed and developed an algorithm to obtain the boundary of clustered hierarchical point clouds based on Voronoi diagram. Designed the framework for alignment and color selection of point cloud.
