## Abstract
Learning by teaching is an established pedagogical technique; however, the exact process through which learning happens remains difficult to assess, partly due to the variability in the tutor-tutee pairing and interaction. Prior research proposed the use of teachable agents acting as students, in order to facilitate more controlled studies of the learning by teaching phenomena. In this work, we introduce a learning by teaching platform, Curiosity Notebook, which allows students to work individually or in groups to teach a conversational agent a classification task in a variety of subject topics. We conducted a 5-week participatory and iterative design study with 16 fourth and fifth grade elementary school children, who taught a conversational robot how to classify animals, rocks/minerals and paintings. This paper outlines the architecture of our system, describes the lessons learned from the study, and contribute design considerations on how to design conversational agents and applications for learning by teaching scenarios.
