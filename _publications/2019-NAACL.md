# Abstract
We present a package of annotation resources, including annotation guideline, flowchart, and an Intelligent Tutoring System for training hu- man annotators. These resources can be used to apply Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) to essays written by students in K-12 schools. Furthermore, we highlight the great potential of using RST to provide automated feedback for improving writing quality across genres.
